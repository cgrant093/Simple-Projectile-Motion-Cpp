This project has been abandoned. 

The original project was an imagination of a naive undergraduate thinking he could make a fully functioning physics engine.
By fully functioning, I mean uses all known physics out there: Quantum, Classical, E&M, and Stat Mech (and their derivatives)

He didn't understand why this didn't already exist.
He now does.

I like to keep this here to remind myself of my former ignorance.
